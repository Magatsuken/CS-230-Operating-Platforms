# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room client created a game called Draw It or Lose It. They wanted to publish the game on multiple platforms.

I did well researching different operating platforms, comparing and contrasting each one.

The design constraints and executive summary helped determine how to develop the code.

I would change the Evaluation section to look cleaner. I wrote paragraphs to describe pros and cons rather than used bullet points so if a client saw the document, it would be harder to interpret.

I would pay attention to any restrictions they would set and also pay attention to any features they want implemented. In the end, the client wants a completed product and if the client is happy, I will get paid.

My approach for designing software was to run the code often to debug anything that goes wrong. Some of the code that I fixed had a TODO list also which helped greatly. In the future I would like to employ both strategies.
